    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix
        together the cookie crumbs, confectioners' sugar and 1/3 cup cocoa. Add
        melted butter and stir until well mixed. Pat into the bottom of a 9 inch
        springform pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes; set aside.
        Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, white sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa and
        flour. Beat at medium speed until well blended and smooth. Add eggs one
        at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in the sour cream and
        Irish cream liqueur; mixing on low speed. Pour filling over baked crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Reduce oven
        temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and continue baking for 60
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a knife, loosen cake from rim of pan. Let cool, then remove the rim
        of pan. Chill before serving. If your cake cracks, a helpful tip is to
        dampen a spatula and smooth the top, then sprinkle with some chocolate
        wafer crumbs.
